# User research 

## Target audience
My audience is people who work in the entertainment industry, people who want to work in the entertainment industry, and people who are just interested in the entertainment industry. I imagine that this would be like an article in a trade magazine like The Hollywood Reporter and Variety. So, it should be readable by many levels of expertise.

## Interview findings
Because of my intended audience, I wanted to interview other MEIM students. I also wanted them to be MEIM students who were not in this class because I wanted to make sure it was readable for people who did not just take a class about telling stories with data. 

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What are the graphs telling you?   | The Box Office revenue dropped hard during COVID and is struggling to recover           |       The Box Office revenue has not quite hit the pre-Covid numbers      |       Hollywood is not as profitable as it used to be      |
|            What is your takeaway from the story?             |                Social media boosts theater attendance                |      Studios are trying to make going to the theater a whole event.        |     Social media is a powerful tool, but I am unsure how studios should use this information        |
|       Is there any other data you would have liked to see about this topic?                   |               Nope                 |   Maybe, for the movie you mentioned, the proportion of that year's total box office that those movies made up          |       How much the social media campaigns actually affected attendance      |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add more data about the individual movies | I will make some sort of visualization that reflects the performances of Barbie and Oppenheimer as a proportion of 2023's total box office. I can also do the same for Minecraft and 2025 so far |
| More linkage between social media and box office                                        |        I think that, in the text, I will have to make it more clear that these campaigns are seemlingly out of the studios' control, they just ride the wave when it happens                                                                         |

Overall, I should make this cleaner and have the story flow in a more clear fashion.
