# Outline
The goal of the project is to show that big Hollywood studios have been leveraging social media campaigns to drive theater attendance post-Covid.

The first story element is about how the total domestic box office numbers were climbing steadily in the years leading up to 2020 (2019 had over $11 billion for the total domestic box office). When I say “total domestic box office numbers”, this means the combined amount of revenue that every movie in a given year makes at the US domestic box office.

The next story element is that theater attendance and box office revenues fall during 2020 because of Covid. This part will be pretty self explanatory. 

After this, in 2021, we see campaigns by the studios to get people back to theaters. This includes the infamous AMC Nicole Kidman ad and ads for Dune stating that watching the movie at home would be a huge disservice to the film. These are moderately successful. 

Then, in 2023, we see the first really successful push to get people back to theaters with Barbenhiemer. Since then, we have seen studios try to duplicate the success of Barbenheimer with their own social media campaigns. This have had varying levels of success, but the box office numbers may show that this is the way to drive attendance and box office revenue.

# The data
This is a database of the box office numbers. I will mainly be looking at the domestic office breakdown by year, but will also be pulling data from specific movies’ performances. I intend to map the yearly trends over the various attempts that studios have done to drive theater attendance post-Covid.

# Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create some visualizations and I will use Shorthand to present my story.
