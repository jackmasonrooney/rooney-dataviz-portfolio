# Animal Rights Index


## Step one: [the visualization](https://theswiftest.com/animal-rights-index/#:~:text=Animal%20rights%20laws%20vary%20greatly,cruelty%20any%20way%20they%20can) 
I chose this visualization because it is about an interesting topic, but it is hard to understand the information in it. I saw this and knew that there was a better and simpler way to convey the story of this dataset. This is what I intend to do with my redesign.



## Step two: the critique
The visualization has a good story, but it overcomplicates it which makes it hard to read. The best part is the overall index score because it clearly represents if a country is good or bad for animal rights. Additionally, I like the corresponding grades to the index score. It makes it easy to compare two countries. I can better visualize the difference between an "A" and a "B+" more than I can the difference between a score of 519 and a score of 463. That's about where my compliments end. The rest of the table is messy, mostly due to the fact that 5 of the 9 factors that affect the index have their own custom icons. Each icon has 3 different variations to represent "full", "partial", and "none". To make matters worse, the key is at the top of the page, so I have to constantly scroll up and down to learn information about any country that is more than 10 or so down the list.

My focus for the redesign will be simplification. The data here is good information, but no one will look at it long enough to get the story. I will want to focus solely on the index score because that is where the message lies. I will try out a map to visualize it clearly. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution
I decided to use a map to visualize this data. I chose a sliding color scale to represent the index values with red being a lower index and blue being higher. I did this because a lower index score means less animal rights and a higher score means more animal rights. 
## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
