# Changes made since Part II
The biggest thing I changed was that I added more visualizations. Before, I was just going to state the box office performances of the movies that I was mentioning. However, this was more engaging and clean. I chose bubble charts for these visualizations because I think it does a good job of clearly illustrating how much of the box office that these films account for. I decided to only show the top 100 or 200 movies for these years because it looked cleaner and still accounted for more than 99% of the total revenue. 

The other thing I changed was that I made the story more clear. It is really about what works in terms of getting people to go to movies. I want my takeaway to be a new way to look at how to market films. The last thing I changed is that I replaced the images with ones that I was free to use via Unsplash. 

## The audience
I think my interviews showed me that I was being too broad with my audience. For the final part, I decided that my audience was studio executives and people that work in film marketing. I wanted to show them that there are more subtle ways to use social media that may actually produce better results than a traditional campaign.

# Final thoughts
Overall, I am happy with it. If I had more time, I would maybe look into how to do this type of marketing for movies with a more serious tone, since both A Minecraft Movie and Barbie are lighter. Oppenheimer is heavy, but that was the point of it being paired with Barbie.
